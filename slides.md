# Matthew 20:29--34
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside.
When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
The crowd sternly ordered them to be quiet; but they shouted even more loudly, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!”
Jesus stood still and called them, saying, “What do you want me to do for you?”
They said to him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened.”
Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes.
Immediately they regained their sight and followed him.

# Matthew 21:9
“Hosanna to the Son of David!”

# Matthew 21:14--16
The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he cured them.
But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he did, and heard the children crying out in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they became angry and said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?”

# Ezekiel 34:15--24 (cf. Jeremiah 23:1--8)
I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord <sc>Lord</sc>.
I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, but the fat and the strong I will destroy\.\.\.\.
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
Because you pushed with flank and shoulder, and butted at all the weak animals with your horns until you scattered them far and wide, I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be ravaged; and I will judge between sheep and sheep. 
I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd.
And I, the <sc>Lord</sc>, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them; I, the <sc>Lord</sc>, have spoken.

# Mk 2:23--28
One sabbath \[Jesus\] was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?”
And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food?
He entered the house of God, when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and he gave some to his companions.”
Then he said to them, “The sabbath was made for humankind, and not humankind for the sabbath; so the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.”

# Mt 12:1--8
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath; his disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
When the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, “Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath.”
He said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him or his companions to eat, but only for the priests.
Or have you not read in the law that on the sabbath the priests in the temple break the sabbath and yet are guiltless?
I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.
But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless.
For the Son of Man is lord of the sabbath.”

# Lk 6:1--5
One sabbath while Jesus was going through the grainfields, his disciples plucked some heads of grain, rubbed them in their hands, and ate them.
But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?”
Jesus answered, “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and gave some to his companions?”
Then he said to them, “The Son of Man is lord of the sabbath.”

<!--
* Michael Wolter: “\[I\]n Luke Jesus argues not from the analogy of the situation but with the help of the authority of David, who overrides an instruction of the Torah. The concern is not with the question of what situations of distress override a Torah commandment... but with the right that David may presume for himself in relation to the Torah.”

# 1 Sam 21:1--9
David came to Nob to the priest Ahimelech. Ahimelech came trembling to meet David, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no one with you?”
David said to the priest Ahimelech, “The king has charged me with a matter, and said to me, ‘No one must know anything of the matter\.\.\.\.’
Now then, what have you at hand?
Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here.”
The priest answered David, “I have no ordinary bread at hand, only holy bread—provided that the young men have kept themselves from women.”
David answered the priest, “Indeed women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition\.\.\.\.”
So the priest gave him the holy bread; for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence, which is removed from before the <sc>Lord</sc>, to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away\.\.\.\.
David said to Ahimelech, “Is there no spear or sword here with you?
I did not bring my sword or my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.”
The priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine... is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you will take that, take it\.\.\.\.”
David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”
