# Matthew 20:29--34
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
There were two blind men sitting by the roadside.
When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!”
The crowd sternly ordered them to be quiet; but they shouted even more loudly, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!”
Jesus stood still and called them, saying, “What do you want me to do for you?”
They said to him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened.”
Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes.
Immediately they regained their sight and followed him.

# Matthew 21:9
“Hosanna to the Son of David!”

# Matthew 21:14--16
The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he cured them.
But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he did, and heard the children crying out in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they became angry and said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?”

# Ezekiel 34:15--24 (cf. Jeremiah 23:1--8)
I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord <sc>Lord</sc>.
I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, but the fat and the strong I will destroy\.\.\.\.
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
Because you pushed with flank and shoulder, and butted at all the weak animals with your horns until you scattered them far and wide, I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be ravaged; and I will judge between sheep and sheep. 
I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd.
And I, the <sc>Lord</sc>, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them; I, the <sc>Lord</sc>, have spoken.

# Luke 3--4: Jesus receives an anointing like David's

# Mk 2:23--28
One sabbath \[Jesus\] was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.
The Pharisees said to him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?”
And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of food?
He entered the house of God, when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and he gave some to his companions.”
Then he said to them, “The sabbath was made for humankind, and not humankind for the sabbath; so the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.”

# Mt 12:1--8
At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath; his disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.
When the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, “Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the sabbath.”
He said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him or his companions to eat, but only for the priests.
Or have you not read in the law that on the sabbath the priests in the temple break the sabbath and yet are guiltless?
I tell you, something greater than the temple is here.
But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless.
For the Son of Man is lord of the sabbath.”

# Lk 6:1--5
One sabbath while Jesus was going through the grainfields, his disciples plucked some heads of grain, rubbed them in their hands, and ate them.
But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?”
Jesus answered, “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and gave some to his companions?”
Then he said to them, “The Son of Man is lord of the sabbath.”

<!--
* Michael Wolter: “\[I\]n Luke Jesus argues not from the analogy of the situation but with the help of the authority of David, who overrides an instruction of the Torah. The concern is not with the question of what situations of distress override a Torah commandment... but with the right that David may presume for himself in relation to the Torah.”

# 1 Sam 21:1--9
David came to Nob to the priest Ahimelech. Ahimelech came trembling to meet David, and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no one with you?”
David said to the priest Ahimelech, “The king has charged me with a matter, and said to me, ‘No one must know anything of the matter\.\.\.\.’
Now then, what have you at hand?
Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here.”
The priest answered David, “I have no ordinary bread at hand, only holy bread—provided that the young men have kept themselves from women.”
David answered the priest, “Indeed women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition\.\.\.\.”
So the priest gave him the holy bread; for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence, which is removed from before the <sc>Lord</sc>, to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away\.\.\.\.
David said to Ahimelech, “Is there no spear or sword here with you?
I did not bring my sword or my weapons with me, because the king’s business required haste.”
The priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine... is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you will take that, take it\.\.\.\.”
David said, “There is none like it; give it to me.”

# This story is not featured in early Jewish retellings of David's story.

<!--
* Josephus simply states that David "requested to receive provisions" (*Ant.* 6.243). 
* Similarly, *L.A.B.* 63.1--2 does not directly narrate David's encounter with the priest, only referencing David's reception of the sword of Goliath from Ahimelech in the context of Doeg's report to Saul.

# 1 Chronicles 23:25--32
\[David took a census of the Levites and organized their houses.\]
For David said, “The <sc>Lord</sc>, the God of Israel, has given rest to his people; and he resides in Jerusalem forever.
And so the Levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the things for its service...
but their duty shall be to assist the descendants of Aaron for the service of the house of the <sc>Lord</sc>, having the care of the courts and the chambers, the cleansing of all that is holy, and any work for the service of the house of God; to assist also with <span v-mark="{color: '#59b58a', type: 'highlight', click: 1}">the rows of bread</span>.\.\.\.
And they shall stand every morning, thanking and praising the <sc>Lord</sc>, and likewise at evening, and whenever burnt offerings are offered to the <sc>Lord</sc> on <span v-mark="{color: '#59b58a', type: 'highlight', click: 2}">sabbaths, new moons, and appointed festivals</span>, according to the number required of them, regularly before the <sc>Lord</sc>.
Thus they shall keep charge of the tent of meeting and the sanctuary, and shall attend the descendants of Aaron, their kindred, for the service of the house of the <sc>Lord</sc>.”

# 2 Chronicles 35:4--6
Make preparations by your ancestral houses by your divisions, following the written directions of King David of Israel and the written directions of his son Solomon.
Take position in the holy place according to the groupings of the ancestral houses of your kindred the people, and let there be Levites for each division of an ancestral house.
Slaughter the passover lamb, sanctify yourselves, and on behalf of your kindred make preparations, acting according to the word of the <sc>Lord</sc> by Moses.”

# 2 Chronicles 35:15
The singers, the descendants of Asaph, were in their place according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and the king’s seer Jeduthun.
The gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not need to interrupt their service, for their kindred the Levites made preparations for them.

# Ben Sira, Sirach 47:9--10
\[David\] placed singers before the altar, to make sweet melody with their voices.
He gave beauty to the festivals, and arranged their times throughout the year, while they praised God's holy name, and the sanctuary resounded from early morning.

# Josephus, *Ant.* 7.305
David composed songs and hymns to God in varied meters.... He also produced musical instruments and taught the Levites to play hymns to God on these on the day called the Sabbath and on other feastdays.

# 11Q5 27.1--11: “David's Compositions”
And David, son of Jesse, was wise, and a light like the light of the sun, and learned,\
and discerning, and perfect in all his paths before God and men. And\
YHWH gave him a discerning and enlightened spirit. And he wrote psalms:\
three thousand six hundred; and songs to be sung before the altar over the perpetual\
offering of every day, for all the days of the year: three hundred\
and sixty-four; and <span v-mark="{color: '#59b58a', type: 'highlight', click: 1}">for the sabbath offerings: fifty-two songs</span>\.\.\.\.\
All these he spoke through the spirit of prophecy which had been given to him from before the Most High.

# David, like Moses, is a “master of the sabbath.”

<!--
* For at least some early Jewish authors, then, when it comes to the temple and the observance of sacred time, David possesses a distinct authority.
  * Why do the Levites serve in their divisions and assist the priests in the temple? Because David commanded it.
  * Why do the temple musicians play their instruments and sing on the Sabbath? Because David taught them.
  * Who gave Israel inspired songs to mark every Sabbath of the year? David did.
* According to the texts surveyed above, David's authority in this sphere is not due to a generic royal or interpretive prerogative.
  * Rather, David's Sabbath authority flows out of his status as the prophetic founder of Israel's temple cult.
  * Stated perhaps more provocatively, if there is any figure within the early Jewish literary imagination that could attain to the title of "lord of the Sabbath," it is David.
